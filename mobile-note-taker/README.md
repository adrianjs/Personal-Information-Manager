# Project 3, React Native
This is a React Native implementation of the React app one folder up.
We reused as much of the code as we could, and the app should look and feel pretty similar.

## Setup
1. Install Expo app on your phone.
2. Clone this repository using Version Control (Git, VCS, GitKraken, whatevs)
3. Run ```npm install``` inside the ```mobile-note-taker``` folder with cmd, bash, terminal, PowerShell -- again, whatevs
4. Once installation is finished, run ```npm start```:
5. When packaging is done, scan the resulting QR-code with your Expo app.
6. You have officially entered the Danger Zone.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
