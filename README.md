# Project 3
This is a "personal information manager", which we took to mean
an app that contains notes, todos and a calendar. Built in React,
with Material-UI. Enjoy!

React Native version of this project is located inside the ```mobile-note-taker``` folder.

While I sadly forgot to include the docs from the other group inside the ```__tests__``` folder, our group collaborated with group 27 on the testing of this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
